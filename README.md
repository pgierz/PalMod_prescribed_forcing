# PalMod Prescribed Forcing
Collection of scripts to transform data for prescribed forcing in MPIESM.

Raw input data is stored in the folder `original_data_ltarasov`.

Transformation scripts (originally written by X. Zhang, originals backed up in
`original_scripts_xzhang`) have been cleaned up and documented **considerably**,
and are stored in `scripts`.

Each may be run with an argument `./$SCRIPT_NAME -h ` to obtain usage
information and purpose.

## TODO:
+ [ ] Xu needs to answer some questions for me...
+ [ ] A `makefile` should be provide to run the scripts in the correct order...
