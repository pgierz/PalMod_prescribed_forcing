# PalMod Prescribed Forcing
Collection of scripts to transform data for prescribed forcing in MPIESM.

Raw input data is stored in the folder `original_data_ltarasov`.

Transformation scripts (originally written by X. Zhang, originals backed up in
`original_scripts_xzhang`) have been cleaned up **considerably**, and are stored
in `scripts`.

Each may be run with an argument `./$SCRIPT_NAME -h ` to obtain usage
information and purpose.
